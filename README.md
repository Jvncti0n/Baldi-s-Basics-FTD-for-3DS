Baldi's Basics Field Trip Demo Port for 3DS

This is a [Homebrew Port of Baldi's Basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldisBasicsEdu/comments/14x5scb/working_on_3ds_port_of_baldis_basics/) For 3DS (New and Old) I made. All credit goes to [MystMan12](https://twitter.com/mystman12) as he is the one who made the original game, I just ported it.
